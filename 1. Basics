<!-- Basics -->

Cell Theory
===========
	* All organisms = *1 or more cells*
	* The Cell is the *structural unit of life*
	* Cells can only arise from existing cells

4 Macromolecules
================
	* Nucleic Acids
	* Proteins
	* Lipids
	* Polysaccharides

Eukaryotic cells
================
	* Endosymbiosis theory -- prokaryote -> mitochondria; 
	  cyanobacteria -> chloroplast
	* Have internal membrane systems

3 Major groups
==============
	* Prokaryotes
	* Eukaryotes
	* **Archaebacteria**

All Cells
=========
	* Highly complex and organized
	* An **open system** constantly adapting 
	* Possess a Genetic program 
	* Capable of producing more of themselves
	* Aquire and utilize energy
		* Catabolic -- degradation
		* Anabolic -- build up/synthesis
	* Engage in mechanical process
	* Respond to stimuli

Cell biology
============
	* Dominated by **protein-protein interaction**
	* Amino Group + Carboxyl Group + R-side chain
	* Read N-terminus -> C-terminus
	* 20 Amino Acids
		* Charged or uncharged
		* Hydrophobicity 
		* Uncharged, but polar

Non-Covalent Forces
===================
	* Electrostatic
	* Hydrogen
	* Van der Waals / Hydrophobic
	* More??

Cells
=====
	* Vary in size and appearance - eukaryotic cells much larger
	* TODO: Eukaryotes vs Prokaryotes - label plant & animal cells, descr. diffs

Various
=======
	* "Central dogma" -- DNA -> RNA -> Protein
	* Trypsin -- breaks anchor to substrate

Model Organisms
===============
	* E. Coli
	* S. Cerevisae
	* C. Elegans
	* Arabidopsis
	* Drosophila
	* Mouse

Self-Study
==========
	* Chapters 2 & 3
	* Diff between Prok & Euk
