<!-- Basics -->

Lipid Bilayer
=============
	* Outer and inner leaflets - Gorter and Grendel
	* Fluid Mosaic Model -- the central dogma of membrane bilayers
		* Transmembrane proteins
			* alpha helix -- portion of mbr protein in bilayer
		* Peripheral proteins
		* Oligosaccharides
		* Glycoproteins


Plasma Membrane
===============
	* Varies based on surface - *apical, lateral, basal* surfaces
	* *Micelle vesicle* rapidly forms - self-sealing
	* There is an *optimal fluidity*
	* **~5nm thick**

Plasma Membrane Functions
=========================
	1. Functional Compartmentalization - proteins & lipids vary by membrane type
	2. Selective barrier
	3. Scaffold for biochemical processes
	4. Transport - passive, active
	5. Cell signalling, eg. action potential
	6. Intercellular interactions - Gap Junctions, etc.
	7. Motility
	8. Energy transduction - eg. mitochondrion

Transport
=========
	* Facilitated diffusion -- any transport that requires a protein channel
	* Active transport
	* Water channel/aquapore
	* etc.

Endocytosis
===========
	* Phagocytosis -- membrane deforms & ingests
	* Pinocytosis
	* Receptor Mediated Endocytosis (RME) -- downregulate signal transduction, 
	  dietary uptake

Phospholipids
=============
	* Phospholipid molecule -- *Head Group - Phosphate - Glycerol*
		* 12 - 20 carbons
	* Saturated -- no double bonds
	* Unsaturated -- one or more double bonds, form *kinks*, *increasing fluidity*
	* cis vs trans fatty acids -- hydrogens on same side in cis
	* leaflet determines composition - eg cytosolic is diff to endoplasmic?

Fluidity maintenence
====================
	* Increasing Temperature -- increases fluidity
		* Transition temperature -- temp at which membrane becomes fluid
	* Degree of Unsaturation -- increases fluidity
	* Cholesterol -- used to optimize fluidity
	* Transfatty acids -- not cis-configured, remain rigid. Bad!
	* *Response to a change in fluidity is typically to counter.*
	* Antarctic fish have highest unsaturaed lipids

Misc Terms
==========
	* Cytokenesis -- Cell division
	* Liposomes -- artificial vesicles used for drug delivery


Movement of phospholipid molecules
==================================
	* Transverse diffusion -- movement within SAME leaflet, extremely fast
	* Lateral shift -- flip between leaflets, slow
		* Requires a **flipase**. Also used to *glycosylate proteins in ER*.

Membrane proteins
=================
	* Functions: Transporters, Anchors (eg. Integrin), Receptors, Enzymes
	* Classifications:
		* Transmembrane
		* Peripheral proteins -- part of protein is hydrophobic & embedded in half
		  of membrane.
			* Anchor or linkage, eg *GPI anchor* 
		* 

Difficult to study
==================
	* Membrane protein study is very tedious
	* Must use detergent - risk of losing original conformation/function
	* Amphipathic -- any molecule with hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts
	* Detergents are *amphipathic* and form *mycelles* around proteins


Study techniques
================
	* Detergents
	* Computational Chemistry
	* Freeze-fracture
	* Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)

Glycoprotein Function
=====================
	* Cell-cell recognition and adhesion
	* Protect from chemical and mechanical damage
	* Absorb water -- slimy surface that (eg. leukocytes) can squeeze through.

Lipid Rafts
===========
	* Specialized domains 
	* **Lots of cholesterol**

Transport
=========
	* TODO: Figure out which rates are the fastest!!!
	* Simple diffusion -- small, lipid soluble
		* hydrophobic and uncharged polar molecules
		* Moves with *concentration gradient* 
	* Facilitated diffusion -- utilizes channels or carriers
		* Active
		* Passive
		* Electrochemical gradient -- positive outside, negative inside

Osmosis
=======
	* Hypotonic
	* Hypertonic
	* Isotonic
	
Port types
===========
	* Uniport -- one molecule, one way only
	* Symport -- two molecules simultaneously, one way only
	* Antiport -- two molecules simultaneously, one incoming one outgoing 

Carriers and Channels
=====================
	* Carriers -- solute binds to carrier, inducing conformational change 
		* TODO: Draw Na+/K+ ATPase
	* Ion Channels -- pore selects ions *based on size and charge*
		* selectivity filter -- controls which ions get through, more than 1mil/sec
		* Voltage-gated - eg. Na+, etc.
		* Ligand-gated - eg. Neurotransmitters
		* Mechanogated 

Regulation
==========
	* Inactivation Peptide -- a type of gate
	* Rest, Open, "Inactivated" states


K+ Channel
==========
	* CFTR -- cystic fibrosis (ion channel disease)
	* K+ Channel -- pore domain, *voltage sensor domain*
	* GLUTs -- glucose transporters
	* Na+/Glucose cotransporter -- a symport

Active Transport
================
	* Na+/K+ ATPase -- requires 1/3rd of cell energy
		* Creates Membrane potential
		* Establishes high K+ inside, high Na+ outside
		* Pumps out 3 Na+, in 2 K+

Na+/K+ ATPase
=============
	* 3 Na+ : 2 K+ ratio
	1. Binds 3 Na+ inside
	2. ATP transports P to protein
	3. Conformational change, low affinity for Na+ -> release
	4. ... TODO

Membrane Potential
==================
	* Charge imbalance -- results in nonzero membrane potential
		* Na+/K+ ATPase establishes gradient, usually *approx. -70mV*
	* Depolarization -- membrane potential becomes *less negative*
	* Hyperpolarization -- membrane potential becomes *more negative*
	* Equalibrium potential -- Net flow of an ion is zero
		* Nearnst Eq -- 59*log10(in/out) - *59 is RT/Faraday*
		* pH = -log(H+ Concen); H+ concen = 1/antilog(ph)

Action Potential
================
	* Rapid conduction wave of electrical potential
	* Thresholded -- all or none event at *approx -50mV*
	* K+ channels -- triggered to open at threshold
	* Voltage-gated Ca+2 channels -- ...

Saltatory conduction
====================
	* Nodes of Ranvier
	* Myelinated axon
		* M.S. a consequence of demyelination 

Toxins
======
	* Tetrodotoxin -- partially blocks Na+, increases threshold, decr. amp & rate
	* Peptide toxin -- reduce rate of Na+ channel inactiation, prolongs AP duration
	* Tetraethla... ions -- block K+ channels, prolong AP

Neurotransmitters
=================
	* Acetylcholine -- excitory NT
	* GABA -- inhibitory NT
