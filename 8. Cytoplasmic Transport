Endomembrane system
===================
	* Nuclear Membranes
	* ER - protein synthesis (RER)
	* Golgi - sorting station, protein modification (such as glycosylation)
	* Endosomes
	* Lysosomes

Smooth ER
=========
	* Muscle tissue, kidney tubules, steroid-producing endocrine glands
	* Function: 
		* Synthesis of lipids, stereoid hormones
		* Detoxification - liver P450 cytochrome 
		* Storage of Ca+2 ions
